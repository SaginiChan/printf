# ALX Printf Project

## Project Description

This is the ALX Printf Project, a collaborative effort by Boaz Sagini and Hellen Atieno as part of the ALX Software Engineering course. In this project, we aim to create our implementation of the `printf` function in the C programming language. The `printf` function is a fundamental and versatile function in C used for printing formatted output to the console. Our implementation of `printf` will allow us to format and output a variety of data types, including strings, integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and more.

## Features

Our `printf` implementation will include the following key features:

- **Format Specifiers**: We will support a wide range of format specifiers, such as `%d` for integers, `%f` for floating-point numbers, `%c` for characters, `%s` for strings, and more.

- **Variable Argument Support**: We will implement variable argument support using ellipsis (`...`), allowing us to handle a variable number of arguments.

- **Formatting Options**: Our `printf` will support formatting options, including field width, precision, alignment, and padding.

- **Return Value**: The `printf` function will return the number of characters written to the output, making it useful for error checking and other tasks.

- **File Output**: We will also include an option to redirect output to a file instead of the standard output (console).

- **Error Handling**: Our `printf` will handle common errors gracefully and provide informative error messages.
